# url-shortner

# DESCRIPTION:

This small project help in understanding Back-End development microservice api for the newbies.

we use React.js as a Front-End and Express.js for the Back-End frameworks.

# FUNCTIONNING:

What you need is to add the url to shorter in the field provided and press the button. You will
be redirected to a new page where to find the resulting informations about the original url you just
provided and the resulting "short url" release of it.

To see how it works, copy that "short url" provided and paste it at the end of the url in
the location bar above.

e.g: you have http://example.com as original url. after cicking the button you have this http://example.com/[api/shorterurl] where you find the info. and after pasting the short url, you will have http://example.com/[api/shorterurl]/[short_url]. at the end you come back to this: http://example.com page.
That will redirect you to the original page of the link (url).
